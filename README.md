# Project Description
## Backstory
  My Senior project in Economics required me to gather historical data for various macroeconomic variables. I wanted my observations to be in quarterly frequency. Some were easy to obtain via the FRED Database Excel plugin. A couple other variables, particularly the S&P 500 index, could not easily be found in quarters or the data provided by FRED did not go back far enough.
